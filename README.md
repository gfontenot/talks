# Talks #

These are talks that I have done at various points.

- [Liftoff]: Quick overview of what Liftoff has to offer, and why I built it.
- [How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love The Functor][Functors]: An attempt
  to demystify Functors by teaching them through `map` in Swift. Also, a plea
  for higher kinded types in Swift.

[Liftoff]: Liftoff/
[Functors]: Functors/
